# Live Scoring Endpoints
-------------------------

### ***NOTE***
Linescore, boxscore, and play-by-play data jobs are queued up every 30 seconds. Once each of these jobs executes, data is pulled from our stats provider and updates are made to our database. The updates are then exposed at that point.
These endpoints do not provide a true real-time update of live data. There will be a minimum delay of 30 seconds. The latency time is also variable depending on how fast the stats provider makes updates.
